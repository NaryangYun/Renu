    <h2>Hwang Jung Eun, 그녀는 누구인가?</h2>
    <p>Hwang was born in Seoul, South Korea. She dropped out of Incheon National University. 
        Hwang learned Korean at a younger age than most kids and was skilled in learning new words (Kyeonggi Ilbo). 
        She started writing books after her short story "Mother" was selected 
        in the Novel Field of 2005 Kyunghyang Sinmun Annual Spring Literary Contest.</p>
    <p>Hwang hosted two podcasts. One was the "Author's Room" section of the 2012 Sound of Munjang 
        and the other one was “Radio Book Dabang” from January 2013 to May 2015. Her latest book is Let Me Continue. 
        Hwang's work Kong’s Garden was translated into English by Asia Publisher. 
        She was one of four featured speakers at a bilingual author’s roundtable in Myeongdong Seoul on September 12, 2015.</p>
