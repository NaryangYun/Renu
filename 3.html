    <h2>Oh JungHee, 그녀는 누구인가?</h2>
    <p>Oh Jung-Hee (Also romanized as O chonghui, O Chong-hui) was born in Seoul on November 9, 1947. 
        She attended the Sorabol Art College from which she received her B.A. in Creative Writing in 1968. 
        Oh made her initial literary impact while in her final year of college as she was awarded the Chungang Ilbo annual award 
        for aspiring writers.</p>
    <p>This work was even more remarkable as Oh began to write it while she was still in high school.
        The story was “The Toyshop Woman,” a dark story about a high-school girl, who is emotionally abandoned by her parents 
        and whose disabled brother dies. This sets her on a path of madness which is paved by kleptomania and sexual obsession.</p>
